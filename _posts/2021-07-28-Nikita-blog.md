**What were the most challenging moments in developing the app?**

One of the most challenging moments was figuring out how to integrate different pieces of code together, especially because everyone has their own way of structuring code. Additionally, it was challenging to figure out how to account for all possible inputs the user could give us.

**What were some of the most enjoyable/memorable moments from the project?**

One of the most enjoyable moments was getting to show what our groups have put together at pathway-wide meetings. Many individuals and subgroups sent me impressive pieces of code, and getting to look at those pieces of code put together at pathway wide meetings was very rewarding. Another memorable moment was coding my first miniature app in RShiny. Even though all it did was upload a CSV file and produce a heatmap, it felt good to successfully implement something in RShiny.

**Were there any unique aspects of the project that you particularly enjoyed?**

I think one aspect that makes our project unique is that we have a group of interns with very diverse levels of experience, and that even those without much coding experience or knowledge of transcriptomics have been able to both teach themselves a lot and to successfully draw on the experience of their fellow group members to successfully implement components of the app.

**What is the one thing you will take away from this experience?**

One of the main things I will take away from this experience is that teamwork fosters technical and personal growth and allows us to produce more successful and impressive projects than we otherwise would be able to.
