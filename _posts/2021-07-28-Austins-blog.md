**What were the most challenging moments in developing the app?**

Learning a whole new world of R: R Shiny, causing me to see UX design in a Bioinformatics light. Also, creating my first website with R Markdown, also a new area of R is was not accustomed to.

**What were some of the most enjoyable/memorable moments from the project?**

Talking with my teammates outside of work. It was awesome seeing everyone have their different goals and ambitions. Teaching my fellow high schoolers bioinformatics. It was awesome seeing high schoolers starting to get into bioinformatics.

**Were there any unique aspects of the project that you particularly enjoyed?**

I think what made this project especially special was how different it was to previous bioinformatics projects I had. In addition to the original pipeline, which I was more familiar with, I had to venture into other areas of R that I was not as familiar with.

**What is the one thing you will take away from this experience?**

How to use R in a way other than developing a bioinformatics pipeline. Providing guidence to others in bioinformatics.

**Anything else you would like to add?**

I really enjoyed this project! It got stressful and confusing at times but overall Iâ€™ve had a lot of fun!
