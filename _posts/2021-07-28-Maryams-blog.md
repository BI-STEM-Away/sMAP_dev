**What were the most challenging moments in developing the app?**

When I decided to work on the Shiny app because I Knew nothing about Shiny at that time.

**What were some of the most enjoyable/memorable moments from the project?**

Communicating with people from different counties is really interesting for me and I enjoy it a lot. One another thing that I like about STEM-AWAY is letting us attend the big Shiny app project and we can have our names on it.

**Were there any unique aspects of the project that you particularly enjoyed?**

One unique aspect of this project that should be appreciated is the attempt of our leads like Samuel, Nikita, and, so on. They spend a lot of time holding meetings and advancing the project. And their efforts are truly commendable.

**What is the one thing you will take away from this experience?**
Experience in remote work in the field of bioinformatics.
