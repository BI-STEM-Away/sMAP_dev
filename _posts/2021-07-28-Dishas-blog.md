**What were the most challenging moments in developing the app?**

For me, the most challenging part of the app development was leading and contributing to this project even though I was completely new to R Shiny. I initially struggled with understanding how to use "input$..."s to actually make buttons, sliders, etc.. After getting better aquainted with R Shiny, my next big challenge was actually implementing the transcriptomics pipeline into the R Shiny app, developing ways for users to get to play around with different functions in a meaningful way. The specific task that I found most challenging was developing the volcano plot code because I wanted to make it so that users could adjust the log FC, but Shiny's normal slider bar doesn't accept non-linear scales; I eventually resolved this using the ShinyWidgets package.
